Life Crystals
 -scattered on planet surface
 -in orbit in asteroids
 -minable?
 -have to be put in the bin to synthesize into a health item

BIN!
 -must have a bin
 -Crystals go in / health item comes out
 -Pretty much the homebase
 -Can't move it. (for now)

ITEMS IN GENERAL
 -hold left click to carry
 -tap right click to use 
   -for example, you can carry health items and equipables, but you must "use" them to benefit from their function like gaining health


Pickaxe
 -this is something carry like normal if you want, but when you equip with right click, it goes to off-hand. and then you can use it by pressing right click again.  and there is another for dropping some preset key.
